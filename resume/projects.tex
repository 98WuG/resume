	{Quantum Mechanical Wave Function Propagation}
	{Processing}
	{}
    {
		A program to evolve arbitrary initial states through time for the one-dimensional Schrodinger Equation and Wave Equation in the absence of a potential field. Highly optimized to run in \textbf{real time}. Accurate to millions of timesteps before noticeable error propagation.

	{An Approximate Solution to the Packing Problem}
	{C++}
	{}
    {
		An approximate, polynomial time solution to the classic NP-hard packing problem. Implemented using the sorting-first greedy approach to packing.
